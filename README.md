# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- pandas (optional, for data exploration)
- Pillow (optional, for data exploration)

You can install them using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy pandas pillow

## Data
The project uses the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The data is loaded using tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data().

## Preprocessing
The data is preprocessed in the following steps:

Reshape the image data from (28, 28) to (28, 28, 1). This adds a channel dimension as the images are grayscale.
Normalize the pixel values between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn.
One-hot encode the labels using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical.

## Model Architecture
The model is a sequential CNN with the following architecture:

Conv2D (32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation): Extracts features from the input images.  
MaxPooling2D (pool size 2x2): Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.  
Conv2D (64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation): Extracts more complex features.  
MaxPooling2D (pool size 2x2): Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps again.  
Flatten: Flattens the pooled feature maps into a 1D vector.  
Dense (128 neurons, ReLU activation): First dense layer for classification.  
Dense (10 neurons, softmax activation): Output layer with 10 neurons for the 10 digit classes.  

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training is performed for a specified number of epochs and batch size.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric on the validation set.

## Running the Script
Save the code as a Python script (e.g., mnist_cnn.py).
Run the script from the command line:

# Note: This is a basic example. You can experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, layers, epochs) to improve the model's performance.
